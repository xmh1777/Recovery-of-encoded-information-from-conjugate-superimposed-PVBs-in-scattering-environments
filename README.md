# Abstract
Using orbital angular momentum (OAM) encoding for signal transmission enables optical communication in the spatial domain. However, during the transmission process of vortex optical communication, environmental factors such as atmospheric turbulence and haze cause scattering effects, results in degradation of signal quality, and increases the complexity of decoding. Our goal is to design a framework that can recover the encoded signal from the speckle field, reducing the effects of scattering. We have designed a neural network model that combines Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and U-Net, which utilizes the image segmentation capability of U-Net to guide GAN in generating accurate information. We have demonstrated its effectiveness in experiments.
